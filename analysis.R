# Script for my awesome project

# In R folder we have all the functions we need to run our code in this script
# Git will only save change once I click "commit"
# "commit" is freezing in time all previous versions
# to send the current version to cloud (github) I have to press "push"
# files in gitignore will not make it past R (so not going to git), 
# you can hide data by adding it to gitignore
